# Build Client App

Use Angular to build out a front end for GoalPosts.

In the client directory, you are provided with some authentication-related code. Ignore this as you work towards a MVP. Focus on building out views that show a list of all your goals and a form for adding goals.

NOTE: Avoid spending any time on styling. Your goal is to create a functioning app. Only think about presentation once you have completed all the required functionality.

## Bare Minimum Requirements

- [X] Complete index.html to include all the scripts you require to run your app
- [X] Explore the client directory and get familiar with what each file is responsible for
  - Add all the modules as dependencies in app.js
- [X] Complete the goals-service with $http requests.
- [X] Build out the following views and controllers:
  X- goals.html and goals-controller.js
  X- detail.html and detail-controller.js
  X- goal-form.html and goal-form-controller.js
- [X] Add your front end routes in the app config.

### Tips:

- Test your views and controllers by loading the app. Since there is no authentication yet you should be able to freely navigate between views.

## Advanced Content

- Add some flair to you app with CSS or a styling framework!
